- Comparing every single element in two strings and counts difference
    ```
    first.indices.count { first[it] != second[it] }
    ```
  
- Primary Constructor & Secondary Constructor
  ```
  class Person(val name: String, val age: Int? = null)
  
  fun kotlin.main() {
      Person("abc")
      Person("abc", 12)
  }
  ```
  ```
  class Person(private val name: String, private val age: Int) {
    val info = "$name is $age years old."

    constructor(age: Int) : this(name = "unknown", age = age)
  }

  fun kotlin.main() {
      val unknown = Person(18)
      println(unknown.info) // unknown is 18 years old.
      val abc = Person("abc", 12)
      println(abc.info) // abc is 12 years old.
  }
  ```
